USIU-AFRICA SMARTNAV WEB APPLICATION
System Analysis and Design (SAD)

1. System Overview
The USIU SMARTNAV Web Application is an open-access, web-based system designed to help students and visitors navigate the campus efficiently. It provides directions to classrooms, offices, amenities, and helps drivers find parking lots and self-manage parking occupancy.
There is no user login — any user can access navigation and parking services anonymously through any modern browser.

2. System Context
Users:
Students (walking or driving)


Visitors (walking or driving)


System Administrator (for backend map/parking data maintenance — secured separately)


External Resources:
OpenStreetMap tiles and routing.


University’s parking lot data maintained in the backend.


Internal building and resource database.



3. Functional Requirements
ID
Description
FR-01
View interactive campus map.
FR-02
Search for classrooms, offices, or amenities.
FR-03
Get walking or driving directions across campus buildings.
FR-04
For drivers: view available parking slots per lot.
FR-05
Register parking on arrival (decrease available slots).
FR-06
Deregister parking on exit (increase available slots).
FR-07
Admin updates building data, amenities, and parking lot capacity.


4. Non-Functional Requirements
Accessibility: Open access, no logins required.


Performance: Map loads within 2–3 seconds.


Scalability: Can handle peak traffic at semester start.


Security: No personal data storage. Admin backend protected by secure access.


Maintainability: Modular structure (Frontend: React + LeafletJS/OpenLayers, Backend: Django REST).


Privacy: No tracking of user identity or behavior.



5. System Architecture
▶ Frontend:
Web-based, mobile-friendly UI.


Renders OpenStreetMap using LeafletJS or OpenLayers.


Shows custom overlays for buildings, amenities, parking zones.


Provides simple forms for parking register/deregister.


▶ Backend:
Django REST API exposes:


Location data


Parking lot status


Basic routes to handle parking registrations


Stores:


Building data


Parking lot capacity & real-time availability


Admin panel for updating map data.


▶ Database:
PostgreSQL + PostGIS for spatial queries and geo-coordinates.


▶ Hosting:
University server or affordable cloud (AWS EC2 + RDS).



6. Data Flow (DFD Summary)
Context Level:
User requests → Navigation Module → OSM → Route/Directions


Driver → Parking Module → Register/Deregister → DB → Update availability


Admin → Admin Panel → CRUD operations → DB → Updates map overlays.



7. Risk Analysis
Risk
Impact
Likelihood
Mitigation
Open Access Abuse: malicious automated spamming of parking slots.
High
Medium
Implement CAPTCHA or rate limiting on Register/Deregister API.
Incorrect Parking Info: users forget to deregister, leading to false full lots.
Medium
High
Add auto-expiry: slots auto-release after X hours if not deregistered.
Data Accuracy: outdated building locations or renamed offices.
Medium
Medium
Require periodic admin reviews each semester.
OSM Downtime: dependency on external map server.
Medium
Low
Host local OSM tiles as fallback.
No Authentication: means anyone can access.
Low
Acceptable — by design for ease of use.


Browser Compatibility: older browsers may not support Leaflet features.
Low
Low
Use polyfills and test across major browsers.


8. Future Enhancements
Integrate QR Code Check-in/out for parking.


Add real-time GPS positioning (optional, consent-based).


Add multilingual support.


Extend to mobile native app if adoption grows.



9. Conclusion
The USIU SMARTNAV Web Application is a lightweight, privacy-respecting, open-access solution to campus navigation and parking problems, designed to be cost-effective and scalable by leveraging OpenStreetMap and simple self-reporting logic for parking slots.
